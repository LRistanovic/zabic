# Zabic

A 2D game engine made for learning purposes


## Info

This project is based on a youtube series on [remaking Cavestory in C++](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNOBk_id22bw6LXhrGfhVwqQIa-M2MsLa), but I wasn't at all pleased with they way code was written and I didn't like the API it provided, so I decided to write my own version of it. It is made with developer experience in mind, and resembles the basics of modern game engines.


## Setup

The project was written using CLion as the editor, so the buildsystem used was cmake. If you are also using this IDE, simply open the project in the editor and compile it like anything else. If you aren't, though, you can build it with only cmake like so:

```
cmake . -B <build directory>
```
